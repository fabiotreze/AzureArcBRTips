# Azure Arc Dashboard in Progress

## Objective  
>Provide customizable example dashboards that offer insights into the performance, security, and configuration of Azure Arc-enabled machines, tailored to your environment.

## Customization

The dashboard is fully **customizable** to meet the **specific needs** of your demo company. Key customization options include:

- **Logos and Branding**: Add your company's logo to match the desired visual identity. For example, during development, Microsoftâ€™s logo was used, but it can be replaced with any other logo.
