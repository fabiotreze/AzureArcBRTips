# Azure Arc Dashboard in Progress

I am currently developing a **Microsoft Azure Arc Dashboard**, with the intention of providing a centralized and customized view of the resources managed in Azure Arc. The main idea is to allow our team to efficiently and personalized view the hybrid and multicloud environments of our organization.

## Customization

This dashboard can be fully **customized** according to the **specific needs** of a demo company. Some customization points include:

- **Logos and Branding**: We can add your company's logo to ensure the dashboard has the desired visual identity. An example of the logo used during the dashboard's development was Microsoft's logo, which can be replaced with the fictitious logo [link to logo - seulogoaqui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabiotreze/AzureArcTips/refs/heads/main/images/lab5_seulogoaqui.png).

## Benefits

- **Centralized Visibility**: A single view of all resources connected to Azure Arc.
- **Layout Customization**: Altering the dashboard structure to better meet your team's preferences and needs.
- **Feature Adjustment**: The possibility to add new features or remove those that are not needed, keeping the focus on essential information.
